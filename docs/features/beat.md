# Beat Scout (type `beat`)

> **Naming:** Publicly this is the **Beat Scout** surface. It can be scoped by geography, topic/criteria, or both. Older repo references may describe the geography-scoped Beat Scout flow with legacy wording.

AI-curated digest with multi-language search and fact-level deduplication.

## Overview

The beat pipeline surfaces niche sources, community blogs, and underreported stories. It supports location-only, criteria-only, or combined location+criteria scoping. Scheduled creation runs a baseline-only pass first: current findings are deduped and hidden from the inbox, the scout gets `baseline_established_at`, and later Run Now/cron executions notify only on new material.

Beat Scouts can run weekly or monthly. Daily schedules are intentionally
rejected because this pipeline fans out across search, filtering, extraction,
and deduplication; weekly is the highest supported frequency.

**Beat Scout modes:**
- **Geography-scoped Beat Scout** — requires a location, optionally accepts criteria. Often used with **niche** sources.
- **Topic-scoped Beat Scout** — requires criteria, no location. Often used with **reliable** sources.

Both flows expose a source mode toggle so users can switch between niche and reliable. The backend pipeline is identical; only the default parameters differ.

**`topic` vs `criteria` vs `description`:** The `criteria` field is the search/filter driver (keywords, inclusion/exclusion rules, thresholds, and notification requirements). The `topic` field is only for organization and UI filtering: store 1-3 short comma-separated tags such as `housing, council, budget`, not a sentence. The optional `description` field is human/agent context shown on scout cards. Every scout must have either a location or topic tags so it can be scoped and browsed. `BeatSearchRequest` has no `topic` field. `BeatExecuteRequest` has both: if `criteria` is empty but `topic` is set, `topic` is copied to `criteria` for backward compatibility with old SCRAPER# records.

## v1 → v2 parity notes

The v2 port preserves all 8 pipeline stages with these clarifications:

- **Stage 1 (query gen):** Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite via Google direct API (legacy used OpenRouter). Schema-constrained output. Caching not yet ported — v1 kept a 24h in-memory query cache with TTL.
- **Stage 5 (tourism pre-filter):** identical 11-domain + 6-title pattern list.
- **Stage 6 (embedding dedup):** scope-aware thresholds preserved (combined 0.85 / location 0.82 / topic 0.80). The `+8` local-language bonus is approximated via a charset heuristic (`/[À-ÿ]/`) instead of `langdetect`, to avoid shipping a heavy ML model in the Edge runtime. Slight precision loss on non-Latin scripts (JP/KR/ZH); flagged as a follow-up if needed.
- **Stage 9 (email summary):** LLM-composed bulletin per category. When the user supplied explicit `priority_sources`, falls back to a plain bulleted statement list.
- **Credit:** 7 credits per run unchanged from legacy. Refunded via `refund_credits` RPC when the pipeline yields 0 URLs or the run errors.

## Deduplication Mechanisms

### Layer 1: URL Deduplication + Quality Filters
- Firecrawl Search is the external-search boundary. `_shared/firecrawl.ts` normalizes both legacy flat results and current `web`/`news` result groups into one `SearchHit` shape with `url`, `title`, `description`, `date`, and `source`.
- The beat pipeline sends `ignoreInvalidURLs: true` and `excludeDomains` to Firecrawl so obvious bad URLs and blocked domains are removed before local filtering.
- Production Beat Scout search uses explicit Firecrawl `sources: ["web"]` for both primary and discovery queries. Do not rely on Firecrawl defaults.
- Do not add `news`, `recent-web`, or `web+news` back to the default path without rerunning the quality audit and updating this document. The 2026-05-02 audit found `news` and `recent-web` were the main sources of locality drift and one-concept topic drift, especially for non-English and civic-style beats.
- `scrapeOptions` is not enabled during search fan-out because Firecrawl charges search plus scrape credits when search results are scraped inline; extraction remains a later, narrowed stage.
- Simple URL-based dedup during search aggregation
- Source dates are normalized through `_shared/atomic_extract.ts::sourcePublishedDate`: Firecrawl scrape metadata first, visible date near the top of scraped markdown second, Firecrawl search date last. This feeds extraction prompts and `information_units.occurred_at` fallback, but it is not a hard relevance gate.
- **Homepage/index rejection**: bare `/`, `/blog`, `/news` etc. are dropped (`is_index_or_homepage`)
- **Standing page rejection**: institutional/section pages with short paths and no numeric IDs (`is_likely_standing_page`) — catches gov landing pages, stats dashboards, agenda indexes
- Removes exact duplicate URLs from multiple queries

### Layer 1.5: PDF OCR Enrichment
- Detects PDF URLs in search results (max 3 per search)
- Scrapes via Firecrawl `/v2/scrape` with `parsers: [{"type": "pdf", "mode": "auto"}]`
- Extracts dates from PDF metadata or text content (multi-language regex patterns)
- Replaces empty/short descriptions with extracted text
- Cost: 1 Firecrawl credit per PDF page (max 5 pages per PDF)

### Layer 2: Embedding Deduplication (0.80 threshold)
- Embeds article title + description
- Clusters similar articles by cosine similarity
- Keeps highest-scoring article from each cluster
- **Language-aware scoring** for non-English locales (see below)

#### Article Scoring (for cluster selection)
When multiple articles cover the same story, the system picks the best one using:

| Factor | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Has publication date | +5 | Dated articles preferred |
| Undated news penalty | -5 | Undated news articles penalized (discovery undated: neutral) |
| Local domain TLD | +5 | `.ca`, `.ch`, `.fr`, etc. based on location |
| Domain rarity | +4 to +8 | Rare domains get higher scores (freq 1 = +8, freq 2 = +6) |
| Discovery pass bonus | +6 | Community/blog sources preferred over news |
| **Language match** | +8 | Article language matches locale (non-English only) |
| Description length | +0-3 | Longer descriptions slightly preferred |

**Language detection:** Uses `langdetect` library to detect article language from title + description. For non-English locales (e.g., Montreal → French, Zurich → German), articles in the local language get +8 bonus, ensuring they win over English articles covering the same story.

### Layer 2.5: Cluster + Tourism Filter (niche only)
- **Cluster filter**: drops mainstream news articles with cluster_size >= 3
- **Tourism filter**: rejects travel blogs and tourism guides by domain/title patterns (niche + location + news category only, via `is_likely_tourism_content`)

### Layer 3: Fact-Level Deduplication
- Extracts atomic facts from articles
- Compares against facts from previous runs (same scout)
- Only NEW facts trigger notifications

## Scope Modes

| Mode | Configuration | Search Behavior |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Location-only** | `location` set, no `criteria` | Local news terms in that location |
| **Criteria-only** | `criteria` set, no `location` | Criteria searches globally |
| **Combined** | Both `location` and `criteria` | Criteria searches scoped to location |

**Validation:** At least one of `location` or `criteria` must be provided (enforced by `BeatSearchRequest` and `BeatExecuteRequest`).

## Source Modes

Source mode changes ranking, filtering, and target count. It does **not** change the default Firecrawl source set; both modes use explicit web search.

| Mode | Retrieval source | Discovery | Date Window | AI Target | Domain Cap |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **niche** | web only | LLM-generated discovery queries | 14d (28d fallback) | 5-6 | 2/domain |
| **reliable** | web only | Limited discovery, depending on generated query plan | 14d (28d fallback) | 6-8 | 3/domain |

## Search Relevance Guardrails

The production default is intentionally simpler than the earlier fan-out design:

- Use explicit Firecrawl `sources: ["web"]` for all generated and discovery queries.
- Forward Firecrawl `location`/`country` when the scout has geography.
- Let the LLM query plan translate/localize queries for non-English locations instead of hardcoding country-specific terms.
- Pass `canonical_query`, `localized_query`, `required_concepts`, and `weak_terms` from query generation into the AI relevance filter.
- For compound topics, the AI filter must require all major concepts. A result matching only a weak generic term such as `AI`, `policy`, `technology`, or `media` is not enough.
- Measure quality by relevance/locality/manual review, not by result count alone.

The regression that motivated this rule: a topic-only Beat Scout for `AI in journalism` returned broad AI stories about the Pentagon, Oscars rules, school boards, and city councils. Those results matched generic `AI` terms but not the journalism/newsroom concept. The fix is covered by the live benchmark canary `topic-only:ai-journalism`.

Audit evidence lives in `docs/benchmarks/beat-scout-search-audit-2026-05-02.md`. Summary:

| Permutation | LLM pass | Warn | Fail | Conclusion |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `default` | 13 | 0 | 0 | Equivalent to explicit web in audit context |
| `web` | 13 | 0 | 0 | Production default |
| `news` | 5 | 5 | 3 | Do not use as default |
| `web+news` | 10 | 3 | 0 | Better than news alone, still dilutes locality/relevance |
| `recent-web` | 6 | 6 | 1 | Unstable; often pulls social/wrong-locality items |
| `recent-web+news` | 5 | 7 | 1 | Unstable |

Future experiments may reintroduce `news` only as a separately ranked freshness lane with its own relevance gate and audit evidence. It should not be blindly merged into the default result set.

### Recency Config by Scope

All scope/mode combinations use a **standard 14-day initial window**. When all dated articles fall outside this window, a **28-day relaxed fallback** is applied (capped at the 90-day absolute floor).

| Scope | Mode | Initial Window | Relaxed Fallback |
|-------|------|----------------|------------------|
| all | all | 14 days | 28 days |

All dated articles must also pass a **90-day absolute staleness floor** regardless of the window.

## Multi-Language Search

For non-English locations, the LLM generates queries in the local language.
Discovery queries (community events, jobs, civic groups) are also generated
in the local language, replacing previous hardcoded translation tables.

## Preview vs Scheduled Mode

| Mode | Dedup | Notifications | Credits | Units |
|------|-------|---------------|---------|-------|
| **Preview** (UI search) | URL + embedding only | Never | Not charged | Not stored |
| **Scheduled** (Lambda) | All 3 layers | Always sent | Charged | Stored |

## Database Records

### EXEC# Records
```
PK: user_xxx
SK: EXEC#{scout_name}#{timestamp_ms}#{exec_id}
Fields: summary_text (from new facts only), is_duplicate
TTL: 90 days
```

### Information Units
```
Table: information-units
PK: USER#{user_id}#LOC#{country}#{state}#{city}
SK: UNIT#{timestamp_ms}#{unit_id}
Fields: statement, unit_type, entities[], source_url, embedding_compressed
TTL: 90 days (extended on use)
```

## Credit Cost

| Operation | Credits |
|-----------|---------|
| Scheduled execution | 7 |
| UI search (preview) | 0 |

## Benchmarking

Run the Supabase-era Beat health benchmark to exercise the real discovery path:

```bash
deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read=. scripts/benchmark-beat.ts
deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read=. scripts/benchmark-beat.ts --scout-id <existing-beat-scout-uuid>
deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read=. scripts/benchmark-beat.ts --timeout-min 8
deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read=. scripts/benchmark-beat.ts --scenario ai-journalism --timeout-min 10 --verbose
```

The default run checks six canaries (location-only, two topic-only, topic+country,
topic+city, second topic+country) through both preview search and scheduled
execution. It retries a canary once on likely transient infra failures such as a
run timeout or zero-result response, but still fails hard on semantic drift.
`--scout-id` replays one existing Beat scout configuration on a temporary
benchmark user to validate backward compatibility without touching the original scout.
`--scenario` filters by scenario name so operators can rerun a single canary
after a production deploy.

The AI journalism canary is the regression sentinel for broad-topic drift. It
requires both AI and journalism/media concepts and rejects the earlier broad-AI
drift terms. Beat retrieval also rejects social/video/community platforms
before scraping; those sources belong to Social Scout or manual research, not
automated Beat ingestion.

When this pipeline changes, deploy both functions that import `_shared/beat_pipeline.ts`:

```bash
supabase functions deploy scout-beat-execute --project-ref <project-ref> --no-verify-jwt
supabase functions deploy beat-search --project-ref <project-ref> --no-verify-jwt
```
