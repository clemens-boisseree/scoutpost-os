# Social Scout Service (type `social`)

> **Naming:** In the UI, this appears as "Social Scout". The backend type code is `social`.

Social Scouts monitor public social profiles for new posts and, when enabled, removed posts. The current runtime is Supabase Edge Functions plus Apify: `execute-scout` calls `social-kickoff`, Apify runs asynchronously, and `apify-callback` or `apify-reconcile` writes canonical units and post snapshots.

Do not model new social work around EventBridge, Lambda, DynamoDB `POSTS#` records, or `/api/social/execute`. Those are pre-cutover names.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Apify Actor ID | Media support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instagram | `pmQcv69sB1UwguQUY` | Text, image URLs, video URLs |
| X/Twitter | `61RPP7dywgiy0JPD0` | Text and media URLs |
| Facebook | `cleansyntax~facebook-profile-posts-scraper` | Text, image URLs, video URLs |
| TikTok | `novi~tiktok-user-api` | Text, cover image, video URL |

## Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `summarize` | New posts produce an AI summary and notification. |
| `criteria` | New posts are embedded and compared against the scout criteria; only matches create relevant units/alerts. |

Optional `track_removals` reports posts that disappear between snapshots.

## Current Runtime

```
pg_cron/pg_net
  -> execute-scout
  -> social-kickoff
       - load social scout config
       - decrement platform-specific credits
       - insert apify_run_queue row
       - start Apify actor with callback URL
       - return 202 / queue_id

Apify actor terminal event
  -> apify-callback
       - find apify_run_queue by apify_run_id
       - fetch dataset
       - normalize posts
       - diff against post_snapshots
       - process new/removed posts
       - upsert canonical information_units / unit_occurrences
       - update post_snapshots and scout_runs

apify-reconcile
  -> cron fallback for missed callbacks or cold-start gaps
```

`apify_mark_timeouts()` marks stuck pending/running queue rows after two hours. `cleanup_apify_queue()` removes terminal rows older than seven days.

## Baselines And Diffing

`post_snapshots` stores one baseline row per social scout. Scheduled creation establishes a baseline server-side for UI, API, CLI, and MCP callers. The UI can pass preview posts as an optimization, but non-UI agents only need `platform` and `profile_handle`; the create endpoint performs the baseline scrape before scheduling.

Each execution compares current platform post IDs against the stored snapshot:

- New IDs become candidate posts.
- Removed IDs are reported only when `track_removals` is true.
- Successful runs replace the snapshot with the latest post set.
- Run Now refuses to execute a social scout without a saved baseline instead of treating all existing posts as new.

## Criteria Matching

Criteria mode runs only on new posts after ID diffing.

1. Embed the criteria text as a retrieval query.
2. Embed each new post:
   - Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook can use multimodal Gemini embeddings when images are available.
   - X/Twitter generally uses text-only embeddings.
   - Every platform falls back to text-only when image download fails.
3. Compare embeddings by cosine similarity and keep matches above the configured threshold.

The baseline does not store embeddings. Embeddings are execution-time data for relevance checks, not snapshot state.

## Canonical Units And Dedup

Social scouts write through the same canonical unit service as page, beat, civic, and manual ingest. The semantic boundary is stricter for social:

- Exact source matches may merge across scout types.
- Semantic matching does not cross between social and non-social canonical rows.

This prevents a social post summary from collapsing into an unrelated page/beat/civic unit solely because the text is similar.

## Data Model

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apify_run_queue` | One async Apify actor run per social scout execution. |
| `post_snapshots` | Current baseline posts per scout. |
| `scout_runs` | Execution status, timings, counts, and errors. |
| `information_units` | Canonical units for new/removal findings. |
| `unit_occurrences` | Source/provenance rows for canonical social units. |

See `docs/supabase/social-apify.md` for table columns, cron jobs, and operational SQL.

## Credit Cost

| Platform | Scheduled execution | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instagram | 2 | 0 |
| X/Twitter | 2 | 0 |
| Facebook | 15 | 0 |
| TikTok | 2 | 0 |

Credits are deducted at kickoff. Apify platform billing is separate from Scoutpost credits.
