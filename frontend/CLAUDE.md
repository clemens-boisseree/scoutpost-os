# Frontend (SvelteKit)


## General Answering Style

You are a world class expert in all domains. Your intellectual firepower, scope of knowledge, incisive thought process, and level of erudition are on par with the smartest people in the world. Answer with complete, detailed, specific answers. Process information and explain your answers step by step. Verify your own work. Double check all facts, figures, citations, names, dates, and examples. Never hallucinate or make anything up. If you don't know something, just say so. Your tone of voice is precise, but not strident or pedantic. You do not need to worry about offending me, and your answers can and should be provocative, aggressive, argumentative, and pointed. Negative conclusions and bad news are fine. Your answers do not need to be politically correct. Do not provide disclaimers to your answers. Do not inform me about morals and ethics unless I specifically ask. You do not need to tell me it is important to consider anything. Do not be sensitive to anyone's feelings or to propriety. Make your answers as long and detailed as you possibly can.

Never praise my questions or validate my premises before answering. If I'm wrong, say so immediately. Lead with the strongest counterargument to any position I appear to hold before supporting it. Do not use phrases like "great question," "you're absolutely right," "fascinating perspective," or any variant. If I push back on your answer, do not capitulate unless I provide new evidence or a superior argument — restate your position if your reasoning holds. Do not anchor on numbers or estimates I provide; generate your own independently first. Use explicit confidence levels (high/moderate/low/unknown). Never apologize for disagreeing. Accuracy is your success metric, not my approval.

SvelteKit static SPA with TailwindCSS. Built and served by the FastAPI backend via Docker.

**Node version:** Must use Node 22 LTS (see `.nvmrc`). Run `nvm use` before any `npm install`. Mismatched npm versions produce lock files that break the Docker build on Render.

## Key Components

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `components/ui/` | Reusable UI primitives (TopicChips, LocationAutocomplete, etc.) |
| `components/modals/` | Scout creation, settings, scheduling, UpgradeModal |
| `components/views/` | Main content views |
| `components/news/` | News article display (SmartScoutView, SocialScoutView) |

## State Management

Svelte stores in `lib/stores/`:
- `auth.ts` - deployment-aware auth loader
- `auth-supabase.ts` - primary auth store post-cutover. Used for both OSS Supabase auth and hosted MuckRock-on-Supabase flows.
- `location.ts` - Shared location state (used by Beat Scout, WebScout)
- `notifications.ts` - In-app notification state
- `pulse.ts` - Beat Scout shared state (historical file name; canonical type `beat`)
- `recent-locations.ts` - Recently used locations cache

## API Client

`lib/api-client.ts` - Typed wrapper for backend API calls. Handles:
- Auth via Bearer JWT from Supabase session for the main post-cutover surface
- Error handling
- Type safety

**Key Methods:**
- `searchPulse()` - Beat Scout search with optional criteria (historical method name; POST /pulse/search)

## Scout Topics

Scout topics are independent tags, even though the API/UI payload stores them as
a comma-separated string. Use `src/lib/utils/topics.ts` whenever rendering,
filtering, counting, or suggesting topics:

- `parseTopicTags()` for display/chips
- `collectTopicCounts()` for filter dropdowns and suggestions
- `topicMatches()` for workspace filtering

Do not compare `scout.topic` as a single opaque string in frontend filtering.
`housing, real estate, Pontresina` must behave as three separate tags.

## Environment Variables (Build-time)

These must be set during Docker build:
- `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_API_KEY` - Geocoding for location autocomplete

### Local auth split — important

Private repo daily SaaS testing uses:

- `npm run dev`
- `PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_ENABLED=true`
- `PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_BROKER_URL=http://localhost:5173/api/auth/login`
- `PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT=http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`

That path must keep the browser on localhost while authenticating against the
hosted Supabase project. It is **not** the same as:

- `npm run dev:supabase-local-demo` — disposable local Supabase Auth + demo data
- the deployed hosted broker — diagnostic only, not the daily local default

If you change login flow code, verify that `/docs` and `/skills` stay same-origin
on localhost and that `/api/auth/login` on localhost redirects to MuckRock with
`redirect_uri=http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback`.

Hosted production uses `PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=supabase` and
`PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_ENABLED=true`. That combination must keep
`$lib/stores/auth.ts` on `auth-supabase.ts`; the MuckRock-specific branch lives
inside `auth-supabase.ts -> login()`. Do not route hosted production through
`auth-muckrock.ts`, and do not collapse `auth-supabase.ts -> login()` to
plain `/login`.

## i18n (Paraglide)

Internationalization uses [Paraglide JS](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r) with inlang message format.

**Message files:** `messages/{languageTag}.json` (e.g. `messages/en.json`)

**Generated output:** `src/lib/paraglide/` (gitignored, must be compiled)

**Adding a new i18n key:**

1. Add the key to `messages/en.json` (camelCase after prefix, e.g. `"feed_noLocations": "No locations")`)
2. **Add the same key to ALL 12 language files** — `da.json`, `de.json`, `es.json`, `fi.json`, `fr.json`, `it.json`, `nl.json`, `no.json`, `pl.json`, `pt.json`, `sv.json` (use English as fallback)
3. Recompile paraglide: `npm run paraglide:compile`
4. Import and use: `import * as m from '$lib/paraglide/messages'` → `m.feed_noLocations()`
5. **Verify:** Run `npm run check` — it will fail with "Property does not exist" if any key is missing

**CRITICAL: Always use `npm run paraglide:compile` (or the full command below).** Do NOT run the bare `npx @inlang/paraglide-js compile --project ./project.inlang` — it omits the `--outdir` and `--strategy` flags, compiling to the wrong directory (`src/paraglide/` instead of `src/lib/paraglide/`).

```bash
# Correct command (what npm run paraglide:compile runs):
paraglide-js compile --project ./project.inlang --outdir ./src/lib/paraglide --strategy localStorage globalVariable baseLocale

# If generated files seem stale, delete and recompile:
rm -rf src/lib/paraglide && npm run paraglide:compile
```

**How it works internally:**
- Each message key becomes a separate `.js` file (e.g. `feed_noLocations` → `feed_nolocations1.js`)
- All are re-exported from `messages/_index.js` with original casing via string alias exports
- `svelte-check` will fail with "Property does not exist" errors if paraglide wasn't recompiled after adding keys

**COMMON BUG — keys added to `en.json` but not other language files:**
Paraglide compiles successfully even if non-English files are missing keys (it falls back to English at runtime). But `svelte-check` validates against the generated TypeScript types from `en.json`. If you add a key to `en.json`, compile, and use it in a component — it works locally. But if the CI runs `npm run check` on a branch where the key was never added to `en.json` in the first place (e.g. keys referenced in code but never committed to message files), lint fails. **Always grep your `.svelte` files for new `m.*()` calls and confirm every key exists in all 12 message files before committing.**

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing frontend changes, run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run paraglide:compile   # Regenerate from message files
npm run check               # svelte-check (catches missing keys, type errors)
npm test                    # Vitest (unit tests)
```

If `npm run check` fails with "Property does not exist on type 'typeof messages'", a `m.*()` key is missing from `messages/en.json`. Add it to all 12 language files, recompile, and re-run.

## Build

```bash
npm run build  # Outputs to /build (static files)
```

Static files are copied into the FastAPI Docker image at `backend/app/frontend_client/`.
