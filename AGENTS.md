# Scoutpost

## Session Preflight

Before coding in this project, read `/Users/tomvaillant/buried_signals/kit/coding-rules/SKILL.md`. It is the canonical source for workflow routing, coding standards, Jujutsu/version-control rules, GitHub operations, and parallel-agent isolation. Local instructions below add project-specific constraints.

<!-- test: verify Codex GitHub Actions workflows -->

## Deployment Workflow - MANDATORY

**NEVER push directly to `main`.** All changes go through a branch + PR. This is not optional.

1. **Check for worktrees first:**
   ```bash
   git worktree list
   ```
   If a worktree exists for the current task, work there.

2. **Create a branch** from `main` (or use `develop`):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature main
   ```

3. **Push the branch and open a PR to `main`:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin my-feature
   gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
   ```

   After the PR exists, always tag Greptile for review with a PR comment:
   `@greptileai review`.

4. **Wait for CI to pass** — 4 required checks must be green:
   - `build-frontend` — SvelteKit build
   - `test-frontend` — Vitest suite
   - `test-backend` — pytest unit tests
   - `lint` — svelte-check

5. **Merge the PR** — Render auto-deploys backend from `main`.

**Why:** Pushing to `main` triggers a Render deploy immediately with no safety net. The PR flow ensures CI passes and Codex reviews the code before anything reaches production.
Greptile review is required on every PR as an additional independent review pass.

---

## Node Version - IMPORTANT

**This project requires Node 22 LTS.** The Dockerfile and `frontend/.nvmrc` are pinned to Node 22. Using a different major version (especially Node 25+ with npm 11) will generate an incompatible `package-lock.json` that breaks the Render build (`npm ci` fails). Always run `nvm use` in `frontend/` before `npm install`.

---

## Frontend ENV VAR TRAP — read this before changing any `PUBLIC_*` or `VITE_*` config

The Vite/SvelteKit/Render env-var pipeline bit us **5+ times** during the v2 cutover (2026-04-21). The pattern keeps recurring because three layers each have different rules and they don't compose intuitively. **Stop and read this section before touching `Dockerfile`, `frontend/.env.production`, or Render env vars.**

### The three layers (in build-time order)

1. **`frontend/.env.production`** (committed): Vite reads this AT BUILD TIME for `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_*` and `import.meta.env.VITE_*` substitution. Source of truth for client-side public values.
2. **Dockerfile `ENV` directives**: process.env during `RUN npm run build`. **Overrides .env.production** because Vite's load order puts process.env first. Hardcoded `ENV X=value` is opaque to Render — Render env vars can't change it.
3. **Render service envVars**: become process.env at runtime. **Only reach the docker BUILD context if (a) declared as `ARG` in Dockerfile AND (b) Render decides to forward — behavior varies by how the var was created (blueprint sync vs dashboard add vs API PUT).** Do not rely on this for build-time vars.

### Rules going forward

- **`PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, `PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_ENABLED`, `VITE_API_URL`**: hardcoded `ENV` in `Dockerfile`. Single source of truth. Don't add to Render envVars (it's silently ignored). To change, edit Dockerfile + commit + redeploy.
- **`PUBLIC_MAPTILER_API_KEY`**: ARG in Dockerfile + Render envVar (it's a secret, has to be Render-side). Empty default means missing-key → degraded map UX, not a crash.
- **Backend secrets (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.)**: Render envVars only. Read at runtime via `os.getenv`. Never in Dockerfile.
- **`.env.production`**: keep it as a redundant source of truth for local dev parity. Vite reads it; Dockerfile ENV overrides it in production builds.
- **Don't add `frontend/.env.*` globs to `.dockerignore`** — that masks `.env.production` from the build context. Use explicit `frontend/.env.local` etc.

### Symptoms that mean you fell into the trap

- `_app/env.js` shows a `PUBLIC_*` value as `""` while Render env vars list shows the correct value → Dockerfile didn't bake it.
- Browser bundle hits the wrong API host → check Dockerfile's `ENV VITE_API_URL=` literal first.
- "supabaseUrl is required" thrown by `supabase-js` → empty `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` baked in.
- New env var added in Render dashboard, no effect on next deploy → it's a build-time var that needs Dockerfile too.

### Verifying a deploy picked up new build-time vars

```bash
# What got baked into the SPA
curl -s https://scoutpost.ai/_app/env.js
# What URL the api-client will call (look at any chunk + grep)
curl -s "https://scoutpost.ai/_app/immutable/chunks/$(curl -s https://scoutpost.ai/ | grep -oE 'chunks/[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.js' | head -1)" | grep -oE 'https://[^"]+supabase\.co[^"]*' | head -2
```

### When to break the rule

If a build-time var legitimately needs to differ between SaaS and OSS deploys (e.g. project URL when forking), then add an `ARG` *with the SaaS default*, override via Render envVar (which DOES work for ARGs declared in Dockerfile), and document in the Dockerfile comment near the ARG. Maintenance escape hatch — exercise sparingly.

## Local MuckRock Auth — DO NOT REGRESS

The private repo has two distinct local auth goals and they are easy to mix up:

- **Daily pre-push SaaS testing:** sign in with a real MuckRock account on `http://localhost:5173`, return to localhost, and view **real hosted account data** before deploy.
- **Disposable demo testing:** local Supabase Auth with dummy/demo data only.

### The correct daily SaaS path

`cd frontend && npm run dev`

This is the default local workflow for the private repo. It MUST keep the browser on localhost while still authenticating against the hosted Supabase project.

Architecture:

- Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`
- Vite proxies `/api/auth/*` to the local FastAPI process on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- FastAPI mounts `backend/app/routers/local_auth.py` only when `LOCAL_MUCKROCK_AUTH_BROKER=true`
- The local broker talks to **MuckRock + hosted Supabase admin APIs**
- The broker resolves the hosted magiclink server-side and redirects the browser back to `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`

Required local browser env contract:

- `PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_BROKER_URL=http://localhost:5173/api/auth/login`
- `PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT=http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`
- `PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_ENABLED=true`
- `PUBLIC_LOCAL_DEMO_MODE=false`

### Production must stay separate

Production auth still uses `backend/app/routers/muckrock_proxy.py` to preserve the MuckRock-registered hosted callback/webhook URLs and forward to Supabase Edge Functions.

Production SaaS is also still a Supabase deployment:

- `PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=supabase`
- `PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_ENABLED=true`
- `frontend/src/lib/stores/auth.ts` must therefore keep resolving to
  `auth-supabase.ts`
- `auth-supabase.ts -> login()` must route through the MuckRock broker when
  `PUBLIC_MUCKROCK_ENABLED=true`

Do not "simplify" this by switching hosted production to `auth-muckrock.ts` or
by making `auth-supabase.ts -> login()` always redirect to `/login`. That breaks
the production MuckRock OAuth start path.

Do NOT:

- make daily local auth depend on `supabase functions serve auth-muckrock`
- make daily local auth depend on the already-deployed hosted broker
- repoint production callback/base URLs to the localhost broker path
- “simplify” local auth by sending the browser to `scoutpost.ai` mid-flow

### If you touch auth, verify all of this

```bash
cd frontend && npm run check
cd frontend && npm test
cd backend && python3 -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
cd backend && python3 -m pytest tests/unit/api/test_local_auth.py -v
cd backend && python3 -m pytest tests/unit/api/test_muckrock_proxy.py -v
bash scripts/ops/strip-oss.sh   # in throwaway copy/worktree
```

Also confirm manually:

- `/login` on localhost shows the MuckRock branch
- `/docs` and `/skills` stay on localhost
- `GET /api/auth/login` on localhost 302s to MuckRock with `redirect_uri=http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback`

### Local launch and browser smoke scripts

Use these when you need a reproducible local UI check:

```bash
./start.sh saas      # Docker backend + Docker frontend at http://localhost:5173
./start.sh oss-demo  # Local Supabase demo frontend at http://localhost:4173
```

`cd frontend && npm run dev` remains the canonical daily private-repo SaaS workflow. `./start.sh saas` is the Docker full-stack path and must preserve the local broker contract above.

After the app is running and the browser is manually signed in if needed, use browser-harness smoke checks:

```bash
scripts/dev/browser-smoke.sh saas
scripts/dev/browser-smoke.sh oss-demo
```

The smoke script uses the current Chrome session through `browser-harness`. It must not type credentials. It opens the workspace, clicks `New Scout`, opens Page/Beat/Social/Civic panels, closes Agents/Preferences, and fails on console errors containing `void 0 is not a function`.

### Supabase test discipline

Keep Supabase integration tests small and direct. Do not build fixture-heavy local Supabase environments just to satisfy one env-gated test.

- For valuable function tests that need real Supabase services, use the local CLI stack and source `supabase status -o env` for `API_URL`, anon/publishable key, and service-role key.
- Runtime smoke tests must be explicitly gated (for example `COJO_SELFHOST_RUNTIME_SMOKE=1`) and guarded against accidental production targets unless the test deliberately opts into remote.
- Prefer local-only auth/API/database checks over external scrape, LLM, email, or Apify calls in CI.
- If a test cannot run, state the exact missing service or env and either wire it from the CLI or remove the test. Avoid vague "needs SUPABASE_URL/API_URL" notes.

AI-powered local news monitoring platform. Users create "scouts" that monitor websites, local news, or search queries on schedules, receiving email notifications when criteria are met. Scouts can be scoped by **location** (geo-targeted) or **topic** (keyword-based), or both.

**Production URL:** `https://scoutpost.ai` — API at `/api/*`

## CLI: `scout`

Shipping product — a Deno-based CLI that talks to the REST API with a JWT
bearer token or `cj_...` API key. Until public release assets exist, install
directly from the public mirror with Deno.

- Source: `cli/` (see `cli/AGENTS.md` for full detail)
- Release tag pattern: `cli-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` — push the tag, CI
  builds + signs + notarizes + publishes the release automatically
- Pre-release suffixes (marked as prerelease on GitHub): `-rc1`, `-beta1`,
  `-alpha1`
- Current install (anyone, no auth):
  `deno install -A -g -n scout https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buriedsignals/scoutpost-os/master/cli/scout.ts`
- Planned binaries: `scout-darwin-arm64`, `scout-darwin-x86_64`,
  `scout-linux-arm64`, `scout-linux-x86_64` — each with a sibling `.sha256`
  file after the first public release is published.
- Release workflow runs on the private monorepo (where signing secrets live)
  and publishes cross-repo via `OSS_RELEASE_PAT`.
- Apple secrets (on this repo only) are listed in `cli/AGENTS.md`. Cert

## Scout Types

| Type | UI Name | Purpose | Scope | Notification |
|------|---------|---------|-------|--------------|
| `web` | Page Scout | Monitor URL for content changes | URL (+ optional topic) | When criteria match |
| `beat` | Location Scout | Location-based news monitoring | Location (+ optional criteria) | Always |
| `beat` | Beat Scout | Topic/criteria news monitoring | Criteria (no location) | Always |
| `social` | Social Scout | Monitor social media profiles | Platform + handle | Always |
| `civic` | Civic Scout | Monitor council meetings for promises | Domain + confirmed URLs | When promises found |

**Location Scout vs Beat Scout:** Both use the same backend `beat` pipeline. Location Scout defaults to **niche** sources (local blogs, community sites); Beat Scout defaults to **reliable** sources (established outlets). Source mode is togglable in both. Location Scout requires a location and optionally accepts criteria; Beat Scout requires criteria only.

**Scout topics are tags:** The UI stores multiple topics as a comma-separated string when saving a scout, but those values are semantically independent tags. Frontend display, filters, counts, and suggestions must use `frontend/src/lib/utils/topics.ts` (`parseTopicTags`, `collectTopicCounts`, `topicMatches`) rather than comparing `scout.topic` as one opaque string.

**Page Scout change detection:** Uses fresh Firecrawl scrape output plus a local, versioned canonical markdown hash stored in `raw_captures`. Legacy Firecrawl `changeTracking` remains only as a migration path for older scouts. See `docs/features/web-scouts.md`.

**Page Scout first-run extraction:** Users control whether to import existing page data via "Import current page data" toggle. OFF (default) establishes baseline only; ON extracts content to knowledge base.

## Data Flow

```
User creates scout → Supabase Edge Function → `scouts` row
                                      └── `schedule_scout` RPC registers pg_cron

On schedule → pg_cron → execute-scout Edge Function:
                                      ├── Route to scout-type executor
                                      ├── Execute scout logic
                                      ├── Store raw captures + information units
                                      ├── Send notification (Resend)
                                      └── Decrement credits via Supabase RPC
```

## Pre-Commit Verification - MANDATORY

**Run these checks before every commit that touches frontend code:**

```bash
cd frontend

# 1. If you added/changed any m.*() calls in .svelte or .ts files:
#    Ensure ALL keys exist in messages/en.json AND all 12 language files.
#    Then recompile:
npm run paraglide:compile

# 2. Lint (catches missing i18n keys, type errors, Svelte issues):
npm run check

# 3. Tests:
npm test
```

**Common failure: "Property 'xxx' does not exist on type 'typeof messages'"**
This means a `m.some_key()` call exists in a component but the key is missing from `messages/en.json`. Fix: add the key to `en.json` and all other language files (`da`, `de`, `es`, `fi`, `fr`, `it`, `nl`, `no`, `pl`, `pt`, `sv`), then recompile.

**Backend tests:**
```bash
cd backend && python3 -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

See `backend/tests/AGENTS.md` and `frontend/src/tests/AGENTS.md` for details.

**OSS mirror check — required when adding SaaS-only files or routes:**

This project ships an OSS mirror via `scripts/ops/strip-oss.sh`. When you add any of the following, you MUST update `scripts/ops/strip-oss.sh` to exclude it from the mirror:

- New backend routers, services, or schemas that are SaaS-only (admin, billing, MuckRock, Linear)
- New frontend routes that are SaaS-only (`/admin`, `/pricing`, `/terms`)
- New frontend components that reference MuckRock, credits, or upgrade flows
- New test files for SaaS-only code

**Verify before pushing:**
```bash
bash scripts/ops/strip-oss.sh  # Run in a throwaway worktree or after git stash
```
CI also runs this validation (`OSS mirror validation` check), but catching it locally is faster.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI runs automatically on push to `develop` and on PRs to `main`. See **Deployment Workflow** above for the mandatory process.

### GitHub Actions Workflows

| File | Purpose | Trigger |
|------|---------|---------|
| `ci.yml` | Build, test, lint (4 required checks) | Push to `develop`, PR to `main` |
| `Codex.yml` | Codex PR assistant (`@Codex` in issues/PRs) | Issue/PR comments |
| `Codex-review.yml` | Auto-review on PRs | PR opened/synchronized |
| `cli-release.yml` | Build + sign + notarize + publish `scout` CLI binaries | Push of `cli-v*` tag (or manual dispatch) |
| `mirror-oss.yml` | Strip SaaS-only code and push to public OSS mirror | Push to `main` |

### Deploy pipeline

```
feature branch → push → CI runs
                          ↓
               PR to main → CI + Codex review + Greptile review
                          ↓
               merge → Render auto-deploys backend
```

## Environment Variables

### Backend (Render)
- `MUCKROCK_CLIENT_ID` - MuckRock OAuth client ID
- `MUCKROCK_CLIENT_SECRET` - MuckRock OAuth client secret
- `SESSION_SECRET` - HMAC signing key for OAuth/MCP broker state; legacy session JWT fallback only
- `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE` - Public URL the browser sees (needed behind proxy, e.g. `http://localhost:5173`)
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - AI access
- `LLM_MODEL` - LLM model identifier (default: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`). Gemini models route to Google AI direct API; others route to OpenRouter.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Gemini API key (LLM + multimodal embeddings)
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` - Web scraping
- `APIFY_API_TOKEN` - Apify API token (social media scraping)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email notifications
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` - internal Edge Function service auth

### Frontend (Build-time)
- `PUBLIC_MAPTILER_API_KEY` - Geocoding
