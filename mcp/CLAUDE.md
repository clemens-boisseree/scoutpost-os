# `scout-mcp` stdio bridge


## General Answering Style

You are a world class expert in all domains. Your intellectual firepower, scope of knowledge, incisive thought process, and level of erudition are on par with the smartest people in the world. Answer with complete, detailed, specific answers. Process information and explain your answers step by step. Verify your own work. Double check all facts, figures, citations, names, dates, and examples. Never hallucinate or make anything up. If you don't know something, just say so. Your tone of voice is precise, but not strident or pedantic. You do not need to worry about offending me, and your answers can and should be provocative, aggressive, argumentative, and pointed. Negative conclusions and bad news are fine. Your answers do not need to be politically correct. Do not provide disclaimers to your answers. Do not inform me about morals and ethics unless I specifically ask. You do not need to tell me it is important to consider anything. Do not be sensitive to anyone's feelings or to propriety. Make your answers as long and detailed as you possibly can.

Never praise my questions or validate my premises before answering. If I'm wrong, say so immediately. Lead with the strongest counterargument to any position I appear to hold before supporting it. Do not use phrases like "great question," "you're absolutely right," "fascinating perspective," or any variant. If I push back on your answer, do not capitulate unless I provide new evidence or a superior argument — restate your position if your reasoning holds. Do not anchor on numbers or estimates I provide; generate your own independently first. Use explicit confidence levels (high/moderate/low/unknown). Never apologize for disagreeing. Accuracy is your success metric, not my approval.

Ships the MCP server surface to stdio-only clients (Claude Desktop, some
Cursor configs, any local agent framework that doesn't speak remote MCP).
The hosted HTTP MCP server at
`${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/mcp-server/` is always the source of truth;
this bridge is just transport translation.

## ⚠️ Release cost controls — read before you tag

Same pattern + same guardrails as `cli/CLAUDE.md` §"Release cost
controls". Short version, re-stated so you don't miss it:

- macOS runners bill at **10× Linux**. One stuck `notarytool submit
  --wait` on 2026-04-22 burned ~1,650 billable minutes.
- `.github/workflows/mcp-release.yml` keeps `timeout-minutes: 25` on the
  Notarize step + a 20-min inner poll loop. Don't remove.
- macOS matrix legs are `continue-on-error: true` + `required: false`.
  A stuck macOS job does NOT block the Linux release. Don't change.
- Release job uses `if: always() && …` so Linux publishes even if macOS
  fails. Don't change.
- Never switch notarization back to `xcrun notarytool submit --wait` as
  a single call. Use the split submit + poll pattern.
- Before tagging, check Apple's Developer System Status — if
  "Developer ID Notary Service" looks stuck, wait.
- To cancel a stuck run: `gh run cancel <run-id>`.

## Architecture

```
MCP client (Claude Desktop) ──(stdio JSON-RPC)──> scout-mcp ──(HTTPS + Bearer + apikey)──> Supabase Edge Function mcp-server
```

- Read newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdin
- For each line: validate it's JSON-RPC 2.0, forward body verbatim to the
  remote, write the remote's response back on stdout (one line)
- Notifications (no `id`) forward but emit no stdout line — per JSON-RPC
- Errors from the forwarder become JSON-RPC error responses so the
  framing stays intact; non-protocol diagnostics go to stderr

The bridge is **deliberately dumb** — it never parses, mutates, or
validates tool payloads. This keeps it forward-compatible with new tools
and new MCP protocol versions without needing a bridge release. Its only
jobs are (1) transport translation and (2) auth injection.

## Release procedure

Identical pattern to the CLI (see `cli/CLAUDE.md`):

1. Pick a semver. First release: `0.1.0`.
2. `git tag mcp-v0.1.0 -m "scout-mcp 0.1.0 — initial release"`
3. `git push origin mcp-v0.1.0`
4. `.github/workflows/mcp-release.yml` fires on the private monorepo:
   - 4 matrix builds (mac arm/x86, linux arm/x86)
   - macOS binaries are code-signed + notarized via the same Apple
     Developer cert used for `scout`
   - Release published on `buriedsignals/cojournalist-os` (public OSS
     mirror) with 4 binaries + 4 sha256 files, via `OSS_RELEASE_PAT`.
5. Smoke test after public assets exist: `curl -fsSL https://github.com/buriedsignals/cojournalist-os/releases/latest/download/scout-mcp-darwin-arm64 -o /tmp/scout-mcp && chmod +x /tmp/scout-mcp && /tmp/scout-mcp --version`.
   Until then, smoke test a source build from `mcp/`: `deno task compile-mac-arm && ./dist/scout-mcp-darwin-arm64 --version`.

## Tag naming

- Release: `mcp-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` (e.g. `mcp-v0.1.0`)
- Pre-release (workflow marks as prerelease on GitHub):
  - `mcp-v0.1.0-rc1`, `mcp-v0.1.0-beta2`, `mcp-v0.1.0-alpha1`

CI injects the version string into `mcp/lib/version.ts` via `sed` before
`deno compile`. Local dev builds stay `"dev"`.

## Structure

- `scout-mcp.ts` — entry point; handles `--version` / `--help`, loads
  config, kicks off the bridge loop.
- `lib/bridge.ts` — `forwardOne` (single line) + `runBridge` (stdin loop).
- `lib/config.ts` — config loader + `remoteUrl` + `remoteHeaders`.
  Reads `~/.scoutpost/config.json` (same file as the scout CLI) with
  env-var overrides.
- `lib/version.ts` — `VERSION` constant rewritten by CI at release time.
- `lib/_test.ts` — unit tests for config, forwarding, and integration.
- `deno.json` — tasks: test, run, compile-mac-arm/x86, compile-linux-arm/x86, compile-all.

## Auth — reuses the CLI's config

- `api_key` (preferred) — `cj_…` key generated in the app at /api →
  Agents → API. Sent as `Authorization: Bearer cj_…`.
- `supabase_anon_key` — **required** when `api_url` is a Supabase host.
  Sent as the `apikey:` header. Without it, Kong rejects the request.
- `api_url` — API base. Trailing slash stripped. Default
  `https://www.scoutpost.ai/functions/v1` if unset.

Env-var overrides: `SCOUTPOST_API_URL`, `SCOUTPOST_API_KEY`,
`SCOUTPOST_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Legacy `COJOURNALIST_*` names are still
accepted as a fallback.

## Why not embed the tools directly in the bridge?

Two reasons:

1. **Single source of truth.** Tools live in
   `supabase/functions/mcp-server/rpc.ts`. Bridge updates would need to
   ship every time a tool is added; forwarder updates never need to.
2. **Auth.** The `cj_…` key lives on the user's machine. If the bridge
   called sibling EFs directly it would need to understand each tool's
   RLS semantics. Forwarding through `mcp-server` means the same
   `requireUserOrApiKey` path gates every tool call.

## Secrets

Identical to the CLI release — `APPLE_CERT_P12`, `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD`,
`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_API_KEY_P8`,
`APPLE_API_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID`, `OSS_RELEASE_PAT`. All sit on
the private `buriedsignals/coJournalist` repo.
