# `scout` CLI


## General Answering Style

You are a world class expert in all domains. Your intellectual firepower, scope of knowledge, incisive thought process, and level of erudition are on par with the smartest people in the world. Answer with complete, detailed, specific answers. Process information and explain your answers step by step. Verify your own work. Double check all facts, figures, citations, names, dates, and examples. Never hallucinate or make anything up. If you don't know something, just say so. Your tone of voice is precise, but not strident or pedantic. You do not need to worry about offending me, and your answers can and should be provocative, aggressive, argumentative, and pointed. Negative conclusions and bad news are fine. Your answers do not need to be politically correct. Do not provide disclaimers to your answers. Do not inform me about morals and ethics unless I specifically ask. You do not need to tell me it is important to consider anything. Do not be sensitive to anyone's feelings or to propriety. Make your answers as long and detailed as you possibly can.

Never praise my questions or validate my premises before answering. If I'm wrong, say so immediately. Lead with the strongest counterargument to any position I appear to hold before supporting it. Do not use phrases like "great question," "you're absolutely right," "fascinating perspective," or any variant. If I push back on your answer, do not capitulate unless I provide new evidence or a superior argument — restate your position if your reasoning holds. Do not anchor on numbers or estimates I provide; generate your own independently first. Use explicit confidence levels (high/moderate/low/unknown). Never apologize for disagreeing. Accuracy is your success metric, not my approval.

## ⚠️ Release cost controls — read before you tag

GitHub Actions macOS runners bill at **10×** the Linux rate. A stuck
macOS job eats 10 minutes of quota for every 1 wall-clock minute. One
runaway `notarytool submit --wait` hang on 2026-04-22 consumed ~1,650
billable minutes before we caught it.

Guardrails in `.github/workflows/cli-release.yml` that must stay in place:

1. **Notarize step has `timeout-minutes: 25`** (outer backstop) **and an
   inner 20-minute poll loop**. The tool will exit cleanly at 20 min with
   `notarization did not finish in 20 minutes (last status: X)` rather
   than long-polling Apple indefinitely. Don't remove these.
2. **macOS matrix legs are `continue-on-error: true` + `required: false`**
   in the matrix `include:` blocks. A stuck macOS job does not block the
   Linux release. Don't flip these to required without a plan for Apple
   notary outages.
3. **Release job uses `if: always() && …`** so the Linux binaries publish
   even when macOS legs fail or time out. macOS binaries re-attach on a
   workflow rerun once Apple's queue is healthy.
4. **Do NOT switch notarization back to `xcrun notarytool submit --wait`
   (single call).** That's the long-poll pattern that hangs; we split it
   into submit → explicit UUID polling. See electron/notarize#179 for
   the canonical write-up.

**Budget check before tagging:** if you're about to burn runner minutes
on a release and Apple's notary service looks stuck
(`https://developer.apple.com/system-status/` → "Developer ID Notary
Service"), wait. A failed macOS arm64 leg + x86 leg together burn
~400 billable minutes at the 20-min cap.

**Cancelling stuck runs saves money:**
```bash
gh run cancel <run-id>
```

## Release procedure

1. Ensure `main`/`migration` is clean and tests pass:
   ```bash
   cd cli && deno task test && deno task compile-all
   ```
2. Pick the next semver. First release: `0.1.0`.
3. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag cli-v0.1.0 -m "scout 0.1.0 — <headline>"
   git push origin cli-v0.1.0
   ```
4. `.github/workflows/cli-release.yml` fires (on the private monorepo,
   where the Apple secrets live):
   - 4 matrix builds (mac arm/x86, linux arm/x86)
   - macOS binaries are code-signed + notarized via Apple
   - Release published on the PUBLIC mirror
     (`buriedsignals/scoutpost-os`) with 4 binaries + 4 sha256 files,
     via `OSS_RELEASE_PAT`. Anyone can `curl` the assets without auth.
5. Smoke test after public assets exist: `curl -fsSL https://github.com/buriedsignals/scoutpost-os/releases/latest/download/scout-darwin-arm64 -o /tmp/scout && chmod +x /tmp/scout && /tmp/scout --version`.
   Until then, smoke test the source install: `deno install -A -g -n scout https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buriedsignals/scoutpost-os/master/cli/scout.ts && scout --version`.

## Tag naming

- Release: `cli-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` (e.g. `cli-v0.1.0`)
- Pre-release (workflow marks as prerelease on GitHub):
  - `cli-v0.1.0-rc1`, `cli-v0.1.0-beta2`, `cli-v0.1.0-alpha1`

The workflow injects the version string into `cli/lib/version.ts` via
`sed` before `deno compile`, so `scout --version` reports the real tag
in shipped binaries. Local dev builds stay `"dev"`.

## Structure

- `scout.ts` — entry point, subcommand dispatch, `--version` handling
- `commands/<name>.ts` — one file per subcommand (config, projects,
  scouts, units, ingest, export)
- `commands/_test.ts` — Deno unit tests
- `lib/client.ts` — REST client (`apiFetch`), `resolvePath` dual-backend
  shim, arg parser, table/json output helpers
- `lib/version.ts` — `VERSION` string rewritten by CI at release time
- `deno.json` — tasks: test, run, compile-mac-arm, compile-mac-x86,
  compile-linux-arm, compile-linux-x86, compile-all

## Dual-backend shim

`resolvePath` in `lib/client.ts` strips `/functions/v1/` from paths when
`api_url` doesn't contain `supabase.co`. Lets the same CLI talk to both the
pre-cutover FastAPI backend (`https://scoutpost.ai/api`) and the
post-cutover Supabase Edge Functions (`https://*.supabase.co`). Remove the
shim after the cutover is complete and all users have migrated.

**api_url convention:** use the Edge Functions base when talking to Scoutpost
or Supabase, for example `https://scoutpost.ai/functions/v1` or
`https://x.supabase.co/functions/v1`. `resolvePath` still accepts older bare
Supabase hosts and FastAPI `/api` bases so existing scripts do not fail during
the migration.

## Auth — api_key vs auth_token

Two credentials are accepted:

- `api_key` (preferred) — `cj_…` key generated in the app at /api →
  Agents → API. Sent as `Authorization: Bearer cj_…`. When talking to
  hosted or raw Edge Functions, `supabase_anon_key` is **also** required
  and sent as the `apikey:` header — the front door can reject bearer
  tokens before the function sees them without it.
- `auth_token` (legacy) — Supabase JWT pasted from browser devtools.
  Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`. Used only for legacy SaaS
  sessions.

If both are set, `api_key` wins. Both can coexist for fallback flexibility
during migration.

The four valid config keys are: `api_url`, `auth_token`, `api_key`,
`supabase_anon_key`. `scout config show` redacts all credentials.

## Secrets
